       " \"Soft dismissal! short ball, aimed into the ribs, but headed down the leg side, kohli flirts with it, and west indies' appeal for a catch down the leg side is spontaneous. harper agrees, and a disappointed kohli goes back. did he show dissent? were there any grounds for dissent? we know not yet... can't tell at all from these replays. as an aside, these are the incidents where drs becomes ineffective if there is no hot spot. makes no sense to have drs without proper technology\",\n",
       " 'Rampaul has taken off, his team-mates rush after him, virat has been bounced out, nothing shot, nothing at all actually, just caught on the crease shuffling across, he was probably expecting the bouncer as he was crouching a tad, instead rampaul gets it to shoot off from back of a length and straighten as well, and before virat could do anything, the ball had taken the glove and lobbed high to second slip',\n",
       " \"Kohli's day just got worse, a loose drive away from his body, it was short of a length and outside off, perhaps should have left it alone, he decides to drive on the up instead, though edwards has been swinging the ball away, duly gets the outside edge and its easy for second slip\",\n",
       " 'Strangled down the leg side, the leg stump line has worked for sammy, he is delighted, lots of jumping, lots of fist-pumping, virat is distraught, there was a big deflection, possibly there was a bit of bat and pad both, neat take from baugh, virat takes an age to go back as umpire kettleborough gives him the marching orders, flings down his equipment as he reaches the dressing room',\n",
       " \"Kohli is gone, not a delivery that normally gets a wicket, flighted and full, kohli jumps down the track, he could have smashed that where he liked, instead he picks out the mid-on fielder, kohli screams in frustration after that shot, i think he's done enough to be the no. 6 on boxing day though\",\n",
       " 'Kohli c limping sammy b hobbling bishoo. lovely twist in the game. this one is short, fair game for the cut, but it turns away too. kohli gets a top edge on the cut. sammy is virtually on one leg, but takes the catch. kohli is distraught. he looks at the pitch as if a best friend has just stabbed him in his back',\n",
       " \"They won't need the new ball for virat, he is gone, all the batsmen have fallen today to the pitched up ball which moves away slightly, kohli is forward in defence, but the movement has done him, and the outside edge is snapped up easily by haddin\",\n",
       " \"It's falling apart for the indians, australia are rolling them over, virat departs now, caught in front, front foot moving across a long way, the bat had to do a lot of work in coming around it, it even brushed the pad on its way down, and the length ball had already nipped in to strike him in front of middle, virat looked rather cross with the decision, wonder why\",\n",
       " 'India lose half their side before 100! yet another one falls to a catch behind the wicket, siddle bowls it in the channel outside off, kohli was forward when he should have stayed back, failed to account for the bounce and it took the edge higher up on the bat, easy take for haddin',\n",
       " \"That was unfortunate for kohli! it landed on that crack on a good length and kept really low, the ball nipped back in sharply after pitching and as he tries to whip it to the on side he's trapped flush in front of the stumps and falls over at the crease\",\n",
       " \"The end of kohli, he was looking so good this session, can't blame any demons in the pitch for that dismissal, a length ball that kohli drives uppishly, warner was waiting at point for that, some exuberant celebrations from siddle, kohli should be kicking himself to be dismissed in this manner after taking his time to settle in, and surviving a testing early phase\",\n",
       " 'Australia complete the demolition job, virat kohli nicks it through to the keeper, an innings and 37 runs, a little more than seven sessions to complete the rout, 3-0 and the series is in the pocket, and in some style too',\n",
       " \"Gone this time, looks to swing an in-swinging full toss on the leg side, the ball dips on him and strikes him in front of leg, aleem dar raises his finger even as virat starts walking, replays show the ball would have swung down leg, adelaide oval gives him a standing ovation, he's come good on this tour, it's time to give the other youngsters their chance\",\n",
       " 'Oh well, that is the last thing india needed, last specialist batsman gets run out off the final delivery of the penultimate over of the day trying to protect the nightwatchman, unbelievable, virat worked a length ball towards midwicket and set off, hilfenhaus, the fast bowler, ran to the ball, threw off balance and found the stumps before virat could find the crease with a desperate dive, comfortably out, australia in a huddle, virat shouts in frustration as he walks back',\n",
       " \"Kohli falls to a poor shot! three of the four wickets so far have been gifts. not very different from sehwag's dismissal, kohli was looking to cut, the ball kicked up a bit more than he expected, he was trying to slash it over the slips but it went at a comfortable height to guptill at second slip\",\n",
       " \"That has got to be out, that is a shocker of a misjudgment from virat, padding up to a good length ball angled in, off you go for that indiscretion, had probably got used to that widish line from southee, who bends it in this time, also came in a bit after pitching, was ending around off stump, virat's pad was already thrust outside off and he had shouldered his arms, plumb\",\n",
       " 'Bowled him, swann has another! more spin for england\\'s chief tweaker, this ripped back from outside off, big gap between bat and pad and the \"pop\" go the bails! kohli didn\\'t get a big enough stride in, he looks at the pitch suspiciously, but that wasn\\'t a great defensive stroke',\n",
       " \"Gone! panesar breaks through again. loose from kohli. hint of width outside off, his eyes light up at the chance of a drive but he doesn't keep the shot down and compton takes a good catch diving to his right at cover\",\n",
       " \"Oh my goodness! what has kohli done! a big full toss from swann and he's slapped it straight to mid-off. came off towards the bottom of the bat as it twisted in his hands. the ground goes silent. no one can really believe they've seen that. joe root, on as sub, is the man to take the catch\",\n",
       " \"Edged and gone, anderson has snaffled kohli, reward for a probing spell! the ball flew low off the edge, not dissimilar to the tendulkar chance in anderson's previous over, but this time swann got his fingers just underneath it, an excellent catch\",\n",
       " \"Full, drifting away this time, driven and and caught behind. superb bowling and now england are into the tail, a loose drive outside off, it wasn't quite up there to drive and the hint of away movement, in contrast to the previous deliveries which had all shaped in, produced a feather edged through to prior who took it comfortably\",\n",
       " 'Around the wicket, leg stump, caught on the pad and given out first ball after drinks and, after a partnership of 198, england finally strike and my word will they be relieved. i think kholi had just misread the line, struck in line with leg stump and it looked a very good shout',\n",
       " \"Yes lyon is indeed looking forward to it. he has stemmed that flood. kohli has got carried away a bit. tis is tossed up, kohli thinks he can go over mid-on, but it is a little too full, and he is a little too close to the pitch of the ball, and doesn't get the desired elevation. having said that, he has timed this superbly, and it takes a superb effort from starc to catch this overhead at mid-on\",\n",
       " 'Ed cowan takes a ripper at backward short leg. he can write about this one. maxwell gets this one to dip as kohli gives him the charge, the ball now has time to spin. it hits the inside edge, and cowan doves to his left at backward short leg to pluck this one',\n",
       " 'Siddle produces the breakthrough. india still have some way to go. siddle gets this to swing in towards off, kohli is a little early into the clip, hits it to short midwicket',\n",
       " 'Given out lbw. well bowled, but kohli plays across the line too. length ball, on middle and off, turns back in slightly. kohli is stuck on the crease and looking to work this to leg. the ball misses the outside edge and hits him dead in front',\n",
       " \"Lbw! kohli has to go. he played forward and across the line to one that pitched in line and spun back to beat the bat and hit the pad. he was well forward. would that have missed leg? it's a tight call, a fair one in the end.\",\n",
       " \"India slide further! kohli has been caught bat pad! but umpire llong is checking to see if shillingford's has overstepped. he hasn't! kohli's gone and shillingford has four. kohli pushed forward to defend the offbreak and it lobbed up off the inside edge on to pad. shillingford was off on a celebratory run even before the ball descended into the fielder's hands. was there an inside edge? it's hard to tell.\",\n",
       " \"That's gone! shillingford gets another one! this one is fuller and going across the the batsman, kohli came forward to defend, but that one kept going away with the angle from round the wicket, a low deflection is neatly taken by sammy at slips and isn't shillingford pumped? he seems to be the only bowler picking up wickets for west indies\",\n",
       " \"Kohli's sold him down the river and he knows it. it was a length ball on middle and the batsman tucks it gently towards midwicket and calls for the single and takes a couple of steps down the pitch before he changes his mind. by that time pujara had motored his way past the half-way mark and despite tahir's overly excited throw, the stumps are broken with pujara nowhere in the frame\",\n",
       " 'What a way to go! kohli is absolutely gutted as he drives the ball straight to duminy, who wasn\\'t entirely sure if that was out. \"catch,\" he asks. so against the run of play was that dismissal. it seemed to be a slower ball and kohli was onto his drive a little too early and the ball simply lobbed to cover',\n",
       " 'Caught behind, four runs short of becoming the first no. 4 batsman from india to get a ton in each innings. it was short, it was wide, but it got a tiny bit more bounce than kohli thought. his late cut results in a fine nick and ab makes no mistake. slaps his bat against his helmet as he walks off',\n",
       " \"He's been caught down the leg side and kohli cannot believe what he has done. again, ab behind the stumps pulls out a brilliant grab! it was a touch short, it was an easy put away through fine leg, but kohli's flick went off the face and the keeper moves to his left having anticipated it, dives and holds on to another screamer. ten minutes to tea and that was exactly what south africa wanted. morkel's exultation tell as much\",\n",
       " \"He's gone first ball! kohli is not impressed with the decision, in fact he looks shell-shocked and keeps staring back at the south africans who are in an euphoric huddle. it was shortish in that off stump channel and he pushed at it with minimum foot movement, the ball carries through low to the keeper who pouches it safely. only it seemed to come off the batsman's shoulder. oops. very difficult call, but he's made the wrong one\",\n",
       " \"What a sharp bouncer. kohli has been given. his reaction suggests it might have gone off the helmet. i am sure it went off the helmet, but did it touch the glove or the bat on the way? forget that. we will check the replay later. for the moment, what a superb bouncer this is. quick, not too short, but somehow rising towards the badge on the helmet. indian bowlers, that's how you bowl a bouncer. kohli is clearly surprised by how much this has risen, and fends at it uncomfortably. second slip takes the catch. many replays suggest that it kissed the thumb on the way. possibly he didn't feel it. there is a slight hot spot mark on the thumb\",\n",
       " \"Is this the break new zealand needed? completely against the run of play. so not a wicket-taking delivery. this is short, this is wide, kohli makes the mistake of pulling instead of cutting. the ball doesn't quite come on, and by the time it does, it is on its way down. kohli gets a bottom edge. that is dying in between keeper and slip, but watling takes it by his toes\",\n",
       " \"He's slapped it straight to one of the short covers! they're going to check the back foot to see if all is good, but this time wagner's got his boot well inside. it was full and wide outside off and kohli threw his bat at it, but fails to place it well enough. wagner exults because this was a plan and it worked\",\n",
       " \"Pitch! what pitch! england have had some magic potion during lunch. he bowls an absolute gem outside off, it straightens after pitching, kohli has to play at that, it catches the shoulder of the bat and lands in second-slip's palms.. two in two overs.\",\n",
       " \"Full, sliding in, kohli plays across it, huge appeal for lbw and given out! an early strike for england and that looked pretty straight, no chance to review of course but i'm sure kohli couldn't have been saved. it was a full delivery that drifted in to beat kohli aiming leg side, he was struck flush and quite low on the pad, almost bang in front\",\n",
       " \"Got him! that was beautifully bowled, angling in towards off, bringing the batsman forward, and kohli's bat was perfectly straight and not far from his body at all but he couldn't do anything about the away movement, and prior takes the outside edge tumbling to his right\",\n",
       " 'Whoah! after nearly an hour of snoozeworthy cricket, plunkett has brought this crowd alive, he has two in two, kohli is gone for a golden duck, he was looking to shoulder arms to a short of length ball that angled in,  that nips in a long way and crashes into the top of off, wow, test cricket',\n",
       " \"In the channel, draws the stroke and kohli falls again, nicked to first slip! he had looked serene until that flash at jordan and now he's been wobbled off his perch by anderson. the ball pitched on a length and hit the seam, taking it away just enough and cook safely pouched it\",\n",
       " 'Slides on again, big appeal, erasmus gives the finger - kohli has feathered one behind! india are four down, their gun batsman has failed to fire again... he threw it up, kohli went at it harder than you would expect a batsman of his class to, smart catch from buttler, just about clung on',\n",
       " \"Gottim, regulation outswinger and kohli tickles it to cook again! two in three balls, anderson has found his groove! again the batsman's hands were magnetised to the ball, kohli is so out of nick his best hope was to miss it but it flicked the edge and continued its delightful arc towards a delighted england captain standing at first slip\",\n",
       " 'Full, good line, kohli pushes forward again, nicks to bell at second slip. anderson has him again. kohli pushed at that again, looked eager to try and hit the ball, just good areas from anderson',\n",
       " \"He's out leaving the ball again! kohli looks dreadfully disappointed. he was on the back foot, shuffling and the ball has stayed on with the angle in at him. dharmasena takes a long look and finally raises the finger. ball tracker says it would have been on-field call, just about kissing off stump\",\n",
       " \"Got him, late swing and nicked to slip! a final failure to launch on a dismal tour for kohli, though he was undone by a cracker of a ball from jordan, a touch fuller and straighter, he was trying to whip it through midwicket but the ball swerved, clipped the edge and nestled in alastair cook's grasp\",\n",
       " \"Down the throat of deep fine leg and johnson has picked the big wicket! it's the bouncer again, it's on middle, it came at the batsman too early and the top edge swirls to ryan harris who rushes in and dives forward to take it. the front-foot check looks scary, but johnson has a couple of millimeters behind the line\",\n",
       " \"Caught at deep midwicket! kohli's gone! australia mob marsh on the boundary and kohli is hunched over his bat at the crease for several seconds before he drags himself off. what an innings it has been. one of the best counterpunches that's been seen in a long time, but it ends off a miscue. it was short, it was asking to be hit and kohli went for a pull to clear the boundary but found the man there. adelaide gives him a standing ovation and he deserves every clap!\",\n",
       " 'Gone! that was short outside off, not wide enough to cut. kohli went for it and the extra bounce caused him to edge it thickly to the keeper',\n",
       " \"Bowled him! kohli shuffled across and poked away from his body at a back-of-a-length ball angling away from him. it may have straightened off the pitch, and it took the inside edge of his angled bat and clattered into the stumps. they're checking for a no-ball, but he's okay. back of his heel is behind the line.\",\n",
       " \"And he gets the big wicket! after 29 overs of toil, johnson has something to show. but check that out for a catch from haddin. he dives full length to his right and plucks it in front of first slip. it was going straight into watson's hands. kohli tried to chase that full and wide delivery, but got a thick outside edge.\",\n",
       " 'He strikes first ball! flicked straight into the hands of square leg. it was a gentle length delivery on the stumps, kohli is not able to keep his flick down and lobs a gentle one for mr burns. kohli cannot believe he has played that shot. big big wicket and the complexion of the game changes completlely',\n",
       " 'Harris has the big wicket early in the morning, kohli is looking for runs, he sees the opportunity with a length ball slanted in just outside off, takes a step or two forward and leans to clip it straight and low to midwicket, not the first time he has gone in this manner this series, he cries out in disappointment, all down to the lower order now',\n",
       " \"Starc gives australia the big one of the india captain, good delivery, slanted in good length and wide, kohli reaches for the drive, the ball straightens and the edge carries to first slip's right, watson snapping it up\",\n",
       " \"The big wicket, and fatullah explodes! kohli looks for another cover drive, but wasn't quite to the pitch of the ball, which was also a touch closer to off stump than the previous ball. it was the googly too. ended up going off the inside edge of his angled bat, onto his pad, and then it rolls into the stumps. was playing a long way in front of his body too.\",\n",
       " \"Gone this time, he is not comfortable playing the sweep, and he has fallen to the shot, it was tossed up full just outside off stump, kohli went for a big forcing sweep, missed it, and umpire llong upholds sri lanka's appeal\",\n",
       " \"Sri lanka are celebrating, they have the big fish, what a take this at forward short leg, there have been some excellent ones this game, kohli was in the mood to get on with it, tried to work this pitched up delivery with the spin, forced it on to the pad off a thick inside edge, it sped near the fielder's right leg and was dying on him when he reacted to dive and pouch it\",\n",
       " 'Beautiful catch. great anticipation as he sees kohli go back. he knows he is looking to open the face, he begins to move, just a step to his right, and kohli gets an edge. mathews is looking to dive and go two-handed, but realises he is close enough to ball, and aborts the dive to take it one-handed',\n",
       " \"Big appeal, and the only question is, has this pitched outside leg? this hasn't. this is the offbreak that doesn't turn too much, and skids on to beat kohli who has gone back to defend it. hit plumb in front after the ball has pitched on a length, in line with the stumps, and just straightened a little against the angle from round the wicket\",\n",
       " 'Does him in! captain takes captain and kusal pouches it this time. reaching too far outside off, he does that, he always does that and when there is away movement, it is too much of a liability. mathews hits a lovely length, draws him outside off. the most kohli can do with this is a block, straight into the covers at best, or at worst, an edge behind.',\n",
       " 'A little juggle at first slip, but he has it under control. fuller delivery on sixth stump has kohli again! pushing forward, playing a defensive stroke with an angled bat that would not have fetched him much runs, and at worse takes the edge as it does here. exactly how he got out in the first innings as well',\n",
       " \"That's rabada's first test wicket, and that of virat kohli, he's caught at cover! it was a length delivery around the off stump and kohli tried to flick the ball but was probably early into the shot and kind of checked his shot. all this led to a leading edge that went low to cover and elgar completed a good, low diving catch. rabada is getting mobbed here!\",\n",
       " \"Well, well, van zyl has taken out the india captain, seemingly innocuous delivery, straightish good length outside off, kohli wants to drive and gets a thin edge, the ball wobbles for a bit in the keeper's gloves but settles in safely, fine take by vilas standing up\",\n",
       " \"Morkel has done it finally to kohli. gets the ball to pitch and move away from kohli who can't do anything but get a thin feather to vilas. that plan has worked yet again. all credit to the sa think tank. stuck to their guns despite the amount of turn. and morkel has more reward, a discernible effort to bowl fuller too. just a hint of away movement claims that wicket\",\n",
       " 'What a shot from kohli. looking to be positive against tahir but kohli perishes. the bat turned in his hands and he has lofted a drive straight to long-off. not a great shot, simply because he was in total control during that innings. tossed up outside off, the ball pitches and takes the customary part of the pitch with it, and it skews off the outside half of the bat, high in the air. faf settles under it and takes it',\n",
       " \"That's an unfortunate dismissal. kohli sweeps from middle and leg, hits it firmly, that was headed to the boundary, but bavuma was in the way at short leg. hit him on the thigh, as he leaped and spun around to avoid the ball, and popped up in the air. vilas was quick to react, moved quickly from behind the stumps and dived forward on the pitch to catch it with both gloves, a fair distance above the ground. superbly done by the keeper\",\n",
       " \"Kohli has been done in by one that kept really low! he'll have to wait another day for his 3000th test run. abbott bowled one on a good length and straight, angling into the right-hander from just outside off, kohli moved across to play on the leg side but was hit low on the front pad - shin height - by one that shot through. a really difficult ball to handle, the only chance kohli had was if he was playing straight. he's played a wonderful innings for india.\",\n",
       " \"140 kph, dragged on! hits the bottom of the bat, the inside edge, and veers onto off stump. india have spoken about not losing wickets either side of a break, kohli himself has been vehement about that. this though - a back of a length ball outside off - seemed to have stayed a smidge low which foiled kohli's attempt to punch the ball through the covers. gabriel barely celebrates. kohli walks off with the respect of the antigua public, some bowing before him.\",\n",
       " \"That's a soft dismissal. chandrika takes a sharp catch at short leg. short of a length, kohli goes back, thinks he can turn it to leg for an easy single, but he plays this straight to short leg, and chandrika takes it shin high\",\n",
       " \"Joseph's first international victim is kohli. bounced out. banged in on a back of a length and swerves in just outside off, 141ks, rears up at kohli and cramps him for room. he is surprised by the extra lift and looks to fend with hard hands. he checked his shot - cut or punch - and just fended it. an edge flies to bravo at first slip. he clasps it in front of his head. opened up and undone by pace and bounce. what a moment for joseph. joel garner, who presented the cap to joseph, would have been proud of that prancing delivery\",\n",
       " \"Cummins spins around, appeals, tumbles, and celebrates. he has kohli lbw. umpire llong's finger goes up. incoming ball on a good length at 137ks. kohli plays down the wrong line and falls over. rapped on the front pad. impact may have been just a shade outside off, but umpire's call it is. the tracker shows that it would hit middle\",\n",

       " \"Full, flighted ball on off stump, and a mix-up ends this promising stand. yikes. rahane gets forward to play the checked drive, well within range of the fielder at mid-off, who's hurtling forward at speed. rahane takes a couple of steps out, kohli responds, then rahane sends him back, by which time he's already halfway down the pitch and in no position to get back. what a moment, ends a brilliantly controlled knock from kohli, and brings the new batsman in with the second new ball looming\",\n",
       " \"Now cummins has the kohli wicket. i think all the wickets at the other end have unsettled kohli, and made him decide he has to take on the bowling. fullish in a wide-ish channel outside off, and kohli does something he didn't do at all in the first innings, attempt a cover drive against such a ball. slices it to gully, where green seems to have taken a clean catch low to his left, but they're checking anyway. soft signal is out. he caught it a few inches above the turf, but the issue is whether it slipped momentarily from his grasp on his way down. there seems to be a bit of a juggle, but it's hard to tell, given he's landing in an area of shadow, so it stays with the soft signal\",\n",
       " \"Wow, moeen has knocked over kohli for a duck. the india captain hangs around. he can't believe what has just happened! moeen tosses it up, finds drift outside off, then it rips back in so very sharply to hit the top of off. this offbreak dips sharply as well, creating distance between the bat and the pitch of the ball, making kohli's attempt to drive through the covers look a whole lot worse. moeen just burst through the gate and silenced chepauk\",\n",

       " \"Kohli's day just got worse, a loose drive away from his body, it was short of a length and outside off, perhaps should have left it alone, he decides to drive on the up instead, though edwards has been swinging the ball away, duly gets the outside edge and its easy for second slip\",\n",

       " \"The end of kohli, he was looking so good this session, can't blame any demons in the pitch for that dismissal, a length ball that kohli drives uppishly, warner was waiting at point for that, some exuberant celebrations from siddle, kohli should be kicking himself to be dismissed in this manner after taking his time to settle in, and surviving a testing early phase\",\n",
       " \"Kohli falls to a poor shot! three of the four wickets so far have been gifts. not very different from sehwag's dismissal, kohli was looking to cut, the ball kicked up a bit more than he expected, he was trying to slash it over the slips but it went at a comfortable height to guptill at second slip\",\n",

       " \"In the channel, draws the stroke and kohli falls again, nicked to first slip! he had looked serene until that flash at jordan and now he's been wobbled off his perch by anderson. the ball pitched on a length and hit the seam, taking it away just enough and cook safely pouched it\",\n",

       " 'Gone! that was short outside off, not wide enough to cut. kohli went for it and the extra bounce caused him to edge it thickly to the keeper',\n",
       " \"And he gets the big wicket! after 29 overs of toil, johnson has something to show. but check that out for a catch from haddin. he dives full length to his right and plucks it in front of first slip. it was going straight into watson's hands. kohli tried to chase that full and wide delivery, but got a thick outside edge.\",\n",
       " 'Harris has the big wicket early in the morning, kohli is looking for runs, he sees the opportunity with a length ball slanted in just outside off, takes a step or two forward and leans to clip it straight and low to midwicket, not the first time he has gone in this manner this series, he cries out in disappointment, all down to the lower order now',\n",

       " \"Gone this time, he is not comfortable playing the sweep, and he has fallen to the shot, it was tossed up full just outside off stump, kohli went for a big forcing sweep, missed it, and umpire llong upholds sri lanka's appeal\",\n",
       " 'Does him in! captain takes captain and kusal pouches it this time. reaching too far outside off, he does that, he always does that and when there is away movement, it is too much of a liability. mathews hits a lovely length, draws him outside off. the most kohli can do with this is a block, straight into the covers at best, or at worst, an edge behind.',\n",
       " 'A little juggle at first slip, but he has it under control. fuller delivery on sixth stump has kohli again! pushing forward, playing a defensive stroke with an angled bat that would not have fetched him much runs, and at worse takes the edge as it does here. exactly how he got out in the first innings as well',\n",
       " \"Well, well, van zyl has taken out the india captain, seemingly innocuous delivery, straightish good length outside off, kohli wants to drive and gets a thin edge, the ball wobbles for a bit in the keeper's gloves but settles in safely, fine take by vilas standing up\",\n",
       " 'What a shot from kohli. looking to be positive against tahir but kohli perishes. the bat turned in his hands and he has lofted a drive straight to long-off. not a great shot, simply because he was in total control during that innings. tossed up outside off, the ball pitches and takes the customary part of the pitch with it, and it skews off the outside half of the bat, high in the air. faf settles under it and takes it',\n",
       " \"Kohli has been done in by one that kept really low! he'll have to wait another day for his 3000th test run. abbott bowled one on a good length and straight, angling into the right-hander from just outside off, kohli moved across to play on the leg side but was hit low on the front pad - shin height - by one that shot through. a really difficult ball to handle, the only chance kohli had was if he was playing straight. he's played a wonderful innings for india.\",\n",
       " \"140 kph, dragged on! hits the bottom of the bat, the inside edge, and veers onto off stump. india have spoken about not losing wickets either side of a break, kohli himself has been vehement about that. this though - a back of a length ball outside off - seemed to have stayed a smidge low which foiled kohli's attempt to punch the ball through the covers. gabriel barely celebrates. kohli walks off with the respect of the antigua public, some bowing before him.\",\n",
       " \"Joseph's first international victim is kohli. bounced out. banged in on a back of a length and swerves in just outside off, 141ks, rears up at kohli and cramps him for room. he is surprised by the extra lift and looks to fend with hard hands. he checked his shot - cut or punch - and just fended it. an edge flies to bravo at first slip. he clasps it in front of his head. opened up and undone by pace and bounce. what a moment for joseph. joel garner, who presented the cap to joseph, would have been proud of that prancing delivery\",\n",
       " \"Cummins spins around, appeals, tumbles, and celebrates. he has kohli lbw. umpire llong's finger goes up. incoming ball on a good length at 137ks. kohli plays down the wrong line and falls over. rapped on the front pad. impact may have been just a shade outside off, but umpire's call it is. the tracker shows that it would hit middle\",\n",
       " \"Gone! kohli, kohli, chasing at a ball wide outside off. this was full, but not quite a half-volley, and on a pitch with this sort of bounce, you shouldn't be playing with an angled bat. ends up slicing it off the outside half of his bat to gully, where latham takes it brilliantly, leaping to his right and grabbing it over his head\",\n",
       " \"Gone, is he? yes, says richard kettleborough! shuffled across to defend this short ball angling into him, and it kept extremely low. hit him at shin height. little he could have done about it, except maybe shuffle outside the line. and the impact may well have been an inch or so outside off stump. the on-field umpire can't see tramlines on the pitch, though, and it isn't an unreasonable decision\",\n",
       " \"Was he struck in line? umpire oxenford says yes. it's a good length ball just outside off, kohli opts to sweep because he wants runs. misses the ball and is struck on the front pad. it's a very tight call. about half the ball is outside the line of off stump. but it's the shot again that may have tempted the decison. a bit like neesham getting lbw to ashwin with respect to impact, patel's ball certainly would have hit the stumps\",\n",
       " \"Holds the catch this time! dramatic two deliveries for stokes at slip. this is full outside off, kohli goes for the drive and it travels very quickly to stokes - a tougher grab than the previous delivery. he snaffles it, then lets out a frustrated celebration. that's how to make amends.\",\n",
       " \"What a screamer. superman stuff from stokes. save this for the highlight reel. save this for cold mornings when you don't feel like playing cricket. watch this catch. you will want to go out. it would have needed something special to end a special kohli innings anyway. this is a flighted legbreak, kohli drives hard at it. this is a full-blooded drive, not some soft edge when pushing at a ball. the edge flies wide of stokes who leaves ground, goes parallel to it, and plucks this one-handed and behind his body. you won't see many better catches than this in the slips\",\n",
       " \"Kohli's gone! this is a massive moment in the game. outside off, maybe nibbles away a touch, kohli was sizing up another glide to third man but instead he merely feathered an edge to the keeper!\",\n",

       " \"Bowled 'im. kohli has left a straight one. was saying it all along that kohli was playing for turn, but the danger was the one that doesn't turn. yes, it pitched outside off. and yes, there has been plenty of turn. but so many of o'keefe's deliveries have not turned. this one too. skids on and knocks back off stump. is that the game? i don't think that was an error in judgement, it was just the wrong approach to batting against spin on this surface.\",\n",
       " 'What has kohli done here? out twice in a row when padding up. and this is a really really \"big batsman\" review from kohli. kohli has just left alone an offbreak headed straight for the stumps. this is plumb as. kohli has a chat with rahul, and for some weird bizarre reason, \"the best batsman\" in the team eats up a review. and he sees the replay on the big screen and walks off even without any confirmation. the crowd is hushed. you can hear a pin drop. anyway here is what happened? kohli went back to look to work this to leg, but then for some reason shouldered arms to one pitched just outside off and on a length. it was hitting middle and leg. he expected it to turn more than it did',\n",
       " 'Kohli is gone. sharp catch at second slip. pin-drop silence in ranchi. he is walking slowly. they are checking for a no-ball. he is well in. a loose shot. wide half-volley, no feet, he drives at it, and the edge flies to second slip, who has crept up because of the low bounce. this one flies at him, giving him little reaction time. he leans back, absorbs the momentum of it, and takes it clean as a whistle. how about that maxwell chase that brought kohli on strike? kohli in the field tried to do the same, and injured himself',\n",
       " 'Herath you beauty! tossed it up for ages and now he pushes one through, back of a length outside off stump. kohli, high on confidence till now, goes after it with a cut. gets an edge that absolutely flies to first slip who gets anxious hands up quickly to his right and holds on as it bobbles. mathews that is. sighs and gratefully tumbles to his right as he finishes the job',\n",

       " 'Edged and taken this time. ab de villiers somehow takes it, at third slip. a tad overpitched outside off, kohli sees a run-scoring opportunity and drives, but the ball moves away ever so late. he moved wider of the crease, and found just enough lateral movement to find the outside edge. it flies to third slip, where de villiers has not seen it. and the ball is flying to him at an awkward height - go reverse cupped or hands down. in the end, he does neither but takes it. excellent captaincy from du plessis, against kohli in fine form, it could have been so easy to push the third slip away to a defensive position, but he had the third slip with lots of lateral movement on this surface.',\n",
       " \"Now he's gone. this time the catch sticks on and kohli's gone. england gets the big wicket. poor shot from kohli. closes the face, perhaps lured by the inward angle, but the ball swings late to take the leading edge and buttler at second slip gets down to his right to snaffle it\",\n",

       " \"And he has got kohli first up but kohli reviews with one second to go. this is desperate reviewing, and he will be hoping there is an umpire's call on it because there is no way this is not out. this is just too good from southee. pitches it up for the outswinger, the ball seams back in after pitching, beats the inside edge on the drive, and he is hit plumb in front. wastes the review. will hate it for rahane or pujara to get a stinker from the umpire now. back to the delivery: this is the classic plan to kohli. keep bowling outside off for swing, and if it seams, you expose the other edge too. tood good on the day. a less attacking batsman would have probably got an inside edge on it, but that was one good nut. swing and seam both\",\n",
       " 'Oh de grandgomme, what a beauty. he has teased, teased and trapped kohli in front. this is excellent seam bowling, and i stand corrected for underestimating him. sir colin, as bazid khan likes to call him. on a length, just outside off, shaping up to swing, but it seams upon pitching and goes past the inside edge to trap kohli in front. no drs review wastage this time',\n",
       " \"Now cummins has the kohli wicket. i think all the wickets at the other end have unsettled kohli, and made him decide he has to take on the bowling. fullish in a wide-ish channel outside off, and kohli does something he didn't do at all in the first innings, attempt a cover drive against such a ball. slices it to gully, where green seems to have taken a clean catch low to his left, but they're checking anyway. soft signal is out. he caught it a few inches above the turf, but the issue is whether it slipped momentarily from his grasp on his way down. there seems to be a bit of a juggle, but it's hard to tell, given he's landing in an area of shadow, so it stays with the soft signal\",\n",
       " \"Some drift, turn and sharp bounce for bess. sharper catch at short leg from pope. tossed up outside off, dips, creating distance between the bat and the pitch of the ball. kohli has a hard-handed waft at it, the ball turns to graze the inside edge and pops to pope who lunges to his right. textbook-style offspinner's dismissal. huge breakthrough for england\",\n",

       " \"Banged in short, and there's the breakthrough! wow, that's a vast moment in this match ... kohli is drawn into a loose defensive waft as the ball gets big on him outside off, and foakes snaffles the skipper for a duck! india have trudged along at barely a run an over, and it's given england the chance to pile on the pressure now\",\n",
       " \"And kohli is gone in the dying moments of the day. not to anderson but to robinson. hard hands, defensive shot to a wide ball, and the edge is taken for root to take it at first slip. this is a shot that won't get him any runs. perhaps he could watch rahul and rohit: either drive or leave. so even if you get the edge, you give yourself a chance to clear the fielders\",\n",

       " \"But he's bowling like hadlee here. third wicket for him, and it's that man kohli. the benefits, once again, of bowling appreciably fuller at headingley. full in the corridor, moving away just a touch, and kohli won't be pleased with the shot he's attempted. looks to drive through mid-off, playing well in front of his body, and only manages to edge it to buttler, who's already had a busy day behind the stumps. this straightened off the seam. wasn't the outswinger. it seemed to come down with a scrambled seam\",\n",
       " 'Got him, robinson picks up his second massive wicket of the morning, length ball, angling into the corridor, and a similar delivery missed the edge a few balls ago. kohli is once again uncertain, has a little push at it, and it straightens with extra bounce to find the edge and carry nicely to first slip falling to his left. what a moment',\n",
       " \"...and he has kohli chopping on. kohli is on his haunches, he simply can't believe it. pushed through outside off and spins away, kohli stretches out and drags it back onto his own stumps to give ravindra his second wicket.\",\n",

       " 'Out first ball. another loose drive away from the body. to be fair to him, this is there for the drive, full and not too far wide outside off. he seems to be playing for the swing, but the ball goes on with the angle and takes the edge through to de kock',\n",
       " \"Rabada gets kohli's edge as well, that's the big one! rabada has his arms in the air, a dejected kohli is walking back. kohli moved across to off again, reaching for the ball, rabada pitched it shorter, it shaped away, kohli poked at it with the bat slightly open and tickled it behind\",\n",
       " \"Great catch at second slip. after all that patience outside off, kohli's been undone by going after one that is well outside off. full on a sixth or seventh stump line, kohli went on the front foot and aimed a booming drive at it, got a thick edge that flew at rapid pace. markram makes a difficult catch look easy, timing his jump perfectly to pluck it with arm stretched out fully above his head. the ball swung a touch as it was reaching kohli, which is why he perhaps got the edge instead of middling it.\",\n",

      "massive appeal for lbw given and kohli reviews. what an over this is turning out to be for ajaz. what a spell. this is really close on whether he's inside edged it or not. the ball is fitting perfectly between bat and pad as he's on the front foot to defend. one half of the ball is near the inside edge, the other on the pad. and there's a spike, but is it due to ball hitting bat first or only with ball hitting pad? there doesn't seem to be conclusive evidence of bat first, though the seam does wobble a bit when it passes the bat. third umpire says no conclusive evidence of bat first. ball tracking has it hitting the stumps flush. and that means kohli has to go for a duck on his return. he has a word with the umpire for a moment before walking off. this match has turned, and how. taken at first slip! it's three for ngidi. i said earlier that kohli fancies himself if he's chasing wide outside off for his favoured cover drive. he fancied his chances with this one too, but ngidi has managed to get late swing away. it's a good length ball, very very wide outside off and swinging away too. kohli makes a big shuffle across and swishes at that, and it's a pretty easy catch at first slip. thin line between glorious and shocking when kohli attempts that shot. ngidi has made the best of it\",\n",
